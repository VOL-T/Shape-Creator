# Shape-Creator

Hi there!
This website lets you create any SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) shape (within limitations, feel free to change those by editing the code).

So, how does this work?
Use the sliders and the color pickers to change the properties of the shape. The shape will then appear and change.

How do I put something like that on my own website?
By clicking the "COPY CODE" button you will copy the polygon's code into your clipboard. You then paste it within the &lt;svg&gt; tag. You can find more details on https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_intro.asp.
