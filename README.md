# Shape-Creator

Hi there, this HTML lets you create any SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) shape (within limitations, feel free to change those by editing the code).

So, how does this work?
You can use the sliders and the color pickers to change the properties of the shape, the shape will then appear with code above it (remember to add the brackets if you want to copy the code for your own use: "</>")

And feel free to check out my GitHub: https://github.com/VOL-T

Have a nice day :)
